Predicting the price of a car using Multiple linear Regression(Data Wrangling)
Step 1 Data Collection:- Data was collected from 1985 price list of different car
Step 2 Data Cleaning:- Missing row and column was either replaced by mean or removed as per the business needs and the data was standardize and normalize accordingly.
the format of data was changed so that the analysis can be done easily.
EDA Exploratory  Data Analysis:-  Data was analysed to see what are the factors which is dependent on the price of the car like Horse-power,engine size,city-mpg,etc
Model Development: A  model was developed using Single Linear regression, Multiple linear regression and polynomial regression.
Model Evaluation: Based on the Root mean square error(RSME) and Mean squared error (MSE) we found that Multiple Linear regression was best fitted.
